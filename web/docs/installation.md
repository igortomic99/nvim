# Installation

Welcome to the installation page. ðŸ˜… 

This config should work on Neovim 0.7+

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nexxeln/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
After creating config you should run

```sh
nvim +PackerSync
```

Of course, don't forget to backup your old configuration just in case you don't like mine.
